# Coda Nets: Image Classification with CIFAR-10

Welcome to the Coda Nets GitHub project! This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Coda Nets aims to provide a simple yet powerful model for classifying images into 10 different categories.

## Introduction

Coda Nets is a CNN model designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

This project provides an easy-to-understand implementation of a CNN for educational purposes and for use in image classification tasks.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive CNN architecture
- Easy-to-follow code and documentation
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Results visualization
- Support for GPU acceleration


### Training and Usage

To train and run the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, run the code-net implementation ipynb file in root folder:

```bash
